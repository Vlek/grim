# grim
CLI-based MUD

In your terminal, enter the world of Grim where you will play in a semi-regular fantasy setting killing monsters, collecting loot, and bragging about it in taverns.

This is meant as a solo game experience. The game world will tailor itself to the actions of the user in a way that could not be done in a multiplayer game.
